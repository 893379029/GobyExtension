The principle of this extension is to send emails to themselves by users themselves. Therefore, you need to configure `Smtp`, `Port`, `Email` and `Auth Code`.

The `Switch` field in the configuration item can control whether the extension is enabled by entering `on/off`.

Take `Tencent Exmail` as an example:

After the configuration is completed, you can click the extension Logo on the `Extensions` tab to check whether the current configuration can send and receive emails normally. If the configuration is correct, you will receive a notification email.
